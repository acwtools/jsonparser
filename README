Usage:
    jsonparser is intended as supplementary code for your own projects.
    main.c provides examples of usage, but is no usable program.


    struct json* readJSON(const char* string, char* error);

    Parses JSON String (UTF8/ANSI Encoded) to json structure.
    If input string is not valid, readJSON returns NULL. char* error will contain a hint why json parsing failed.

    After parsing a JSON to struct json* the resulting structure is mutable, so you can add or remove parts of structure.
    To archive this, jsonhelper.h provides several functions.


    char* writeJSON(struct json* node);

    Translates struct json* to UTF-8 encoded, ANSI-Transport-Safe JSON String.
